# CNN-ObjectDetection
In this project, I used YOLO algorithm trained on [Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vinayakshanawad/weedcrop-image-dataset?resource=download) for object detection task with Inference on video data using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). I used pretrained Yolov3 model which can downloaded from the official YOLO [Website](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/)

### System Requirements

To run the model, it is recommended that you have the following system requirements:

- A good CPU and a GPU with at least 4GB memory
- At least 8GB of RAM
- An active internet connection to download the YOLOv2 weights and cfg file.

### Required Libraries

The following Python libraries were used in the making and testing of this project, along with their version numbers:

- Python: 3.6.7
- Numpy: 1.16.4
- Tensorflow: 1.13.1
- Keras: 2.2.4
- PIL: 4.3.0

## The Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Weed Crop Image Dataset. It contains over 2822 images.

### Subset

Weed are annotated in YOLO v5 PyTorch format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:

Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:

Equal probability of one of the following 90-degree rotations: none, clockwise, counter-clockwise
Random shear of between -15째 to +15째 horizontally and -15째 to +15째 vertically
Random brigthness adjustment of between -25 and +25 percent

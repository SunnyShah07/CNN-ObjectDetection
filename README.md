# CNN-ObjectDetection
In this project, I used YOLOv8 algorithm trained on [Dataset](https://universe.roboflow.com/weed-detection-ojsbj/weed-detection-twccc) for video-object detection task specifically on a weed grass. Inference on video data using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and is showed using a Flask Framework. I used pretrained Yolov8 model which can be downloaded from the official YOLO [Website](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/)

## Requirements

### System Requirements

To run the model, it is recommended that you have the following system requirements:

- A good CPU and a GPU with at least 4GB memory
- At least 8GB of RAM
- An active internet connection to download the YOLOv8 weights, cfg file and .pt files.

### The Dataset

The [Dataset](https://universe.roboflow.com/weed-detection-ojsbj/weed-detection-twccc) used in this project is for weed detection that contains images of crops with and without weeds. The dataset contains 1,008 annotated images, where each image is labeled as either "weed" or "not weed". The images were captured using a smartphone camera and contain varying lighting conditions, angles, and backgrounds.

The dataset could be used to train a machine learning model to detect weeds in crops. This could be useful for farmers to identify and remove weeds from their crops, which can help increase yield and reduce crop loss. The dataset may also be used for research purposes in the field of computer vision and image analysis.

Weed are annotated in YOLO v8 PyTorch format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:

Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:

Equal probability of one of the following 90-degree rotations: none, clockwise, counter-clockwise
Random shear of between -15째 to +15째 horizontally and -15째 to +15째 vertically
Random brigthness adjustment of between -25 and +25 percent

### Implmentation ScreenShot 

Here's an example of how the original images look:

Here the screenshots are of a Web-app created in Flask Framework, here the idea was to upload a video, run a object detection model and the download that, Even there's an option to view the history of all the videos.

This is the screenshot of an output video, where the model is detecting the weed from the other type of grass by bounding boxes.

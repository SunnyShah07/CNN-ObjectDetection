# CNN-ObjectDetection
In this project, I used YOLO algorithm trained on [Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vinayakshanawad/weedcrop-image-dataset?resource=download) for object detection task with Inference on video data using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). I used pretrained Yolov3 model which can downloaded from the official YOLO [Website](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/)
